  <p> This White-winged wood duck is classified an endagered species under the IUCN Red List. I choose this topic and species because I rarely see people talk about. I once before did a project on endangered species and this bird was one I listed. I decided to go back and learn more about it. I also just like really ducks. I provided information regarding this species. Click on any topic below to learn more about this species of bird.
